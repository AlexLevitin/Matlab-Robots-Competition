# Matlab-Robots-Competition
This is the final project in Matlab lab. This is a competition between students.<br/>
In this game there are two robots competeing against each other, with fuel tanks and bombs scatter in the area, when each bomb reduces fuel ammount and each fuel tank increases fuel ammount. When the robots touch the one with more fuel wins.<br/>
We got some simple examples to understand the game better("robotstrategy_.m)<br/>
Everyone writes their own code for their robot to tell it how to move according to the situation in the game.And then the lecturer made the robots compete against each 
other, in a way that every robot competed with every other robot 10 times. The robot that won the most ammount of games got 1st place and so on.
My robot is written in the "MyRobot.m" file, and I won 3rd place in this competition.<br/>
To run the code simply run the"rungame.m" file.
